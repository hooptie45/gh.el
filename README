This is a (very early) GitHub client library for Emacs.

Dependencies:
- pcache.el : https://github.com/sigma/pcache
- logito.el : https://github.com/sigma/logito

This library also allows implementation of the various authentication schemes (password, OAuth).

Implementation is heavily based on EIEIO so that various components can be replaced easily.

Current state:
- basic API v3 handler
- functional password-based authentication
- basic but usable low-level Gist API

Development:
To help developing gh.el, fork the project and issue a pull request.
To run the tests check the Makefile and make sure you load the
required libs with.

EFLAGS = -l ../pcache/pcache.el -l ../logito/logito.el -l ../mocker.el/mocker.el
